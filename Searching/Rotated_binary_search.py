# An element in a sorted array can be found in O(log n) time via binary search. 
# But suppose we rotate an ascending order sorted array at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. 
# So for instance, 1 2 3 4 5 might become 3 4 5 1 2. Devise a way to find an element in the rotated array in O(log n) time.
# The idea is to find the pivot point, divide the array in two sub-arrays and call binary search.
# The main idea for finding pivot is â€“ for a sorted (in increasing order) and pivoted array, 
# pivot element is the only only element for which next element to it is smaller than it.
